Events Calendar add-on for [GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/ "Best Directory Plugin for WordPress") allows to extend your GeoDirectory powered website with a versatile event manager.

== Description ==

The Events Calendar add/on for GeoDirectory is a compelling way to feature events on your directory, using Custom Post Types (CPT). This events calendar plugin creates the CPT Events, by adding time and date to a standard listing. Users can now choose to list a place or an event.

= Recurring Events Included =

Do you host the same event every day, or every second week, or every 3 months, or once every 4 years? The Events Calendar for GeoDirectory has your back!

You can set events as recurring type daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and even pick custom dates. 
The recurring interval can be from 1 to 30. 

So if you select type weekly and interval 2, the events will happen every 2 weeks.

= Events Calendar Widgets, Shortcodes or Blocks =

It's easy to sort events by selecting "upcoming," "today," "past" or "all" and display custom events lists, grids and a simple events calendar anywhere using Widgets, Shortcodes or Blocks. By default, events are ordered with the upcoming event first.

= Events Locator =

The Events Calendar for GeoDirectory is a full-featured Events Locator too. Events are easily displayed on a map, allowing user to locate your events with ease. Easily show distance from them and driving directions.
