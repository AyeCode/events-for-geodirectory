The Events Calendar add-on for [GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/ "Best Directory Plugin for WordPress") is a compelling way to feature events on your directory, using Custom Post Types (CPT). This events calendar plugin creates the CPT Events, by adding time and date to a standard listing. Users can now choose to list a place or an event.

= Recurring Events Included =

Do you host the same event every day, or every second week, or every 3 months, or once every 4 years? The Events Calendar for GeoDirectory has your back!

You can set events as recurring type daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and even pick custom dates. 
The recurring interval can be from 1 to 30. 

So if you select type weekly and interval 2, the events will happen every 2 weeks.
